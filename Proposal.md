#  Proposal for server-side "template instantiation" - HTML (including moustache) rewriting

## Backdrop

One amazing achievement the WHATWG can take pride of in the past decade has been its reach beyond the browser -- a whole ecosystem has developed that allows for "isomorphic" code to work both on the server and in the browser (as well as during the build process), driven by the painstaking standards work of the WHATWG.

In particular, the tech stack that service workers tap into  -- including fetch, streaming, ES modules, caching, indexedDB, etc. can be utilized on the server-side, with solutions like CloudFlare Workers, Deno, Bun, and increasingly Node.  

We are seeing significant interest in solutions like [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), that enable easy swapping between server-side vs. client-side components.

But I believe there is one significant missing piece in the standards, where the WHATWG could benefit from a bit of humility, perhaps, and absorb ideas in the opposite direction.

Generating HTML with the help of language-neutral, declarative "static" templates (as opposed to servlet-like JavaScript) has proven itself over many [decades](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/) of web development.  I think providing some server-side primitives to help these engines be able to handle complex scenarios, including embedding dynamic data into a stream of static templates, would be a "slam-dunk" win for the platform.

Such an idea has taken root in [a number](https://bun.sh/docs/api/html-rewriter#:~:text=Bun%20provides%20a%20fast%20native%20implementation%20of%20the,console.log%28el.tagName%29%3B%20%2F%2F%20%22body%22%20%7C%20%22div%22%20%7C...%20%7D%2C%20%7D%29%3B) [of](https://github.com/worker-tools/html-rewriter) these solutions - the [HTML Rewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter).  This proposal, in essence, seeks to incorporate an enhanced version of that proven, mature solution (with additional support for moustache markers).

Doing so would have a countless number of applications from the mundane but important "slam-dunk" use cases, to the more revolutionary, as discussed below.

## Edge of Tomorrow Design Pattern

The first use case, half-way between mundane and revolutionary, for this proposal would be "iframes 2.0" without the performance (and rectangular topology) penalty.

To quote the good people of [github](https://github.com/github/include-fragment-element#relation-to-server-side-includes):

>This declarative approach is very similar to SSI or ESI directives. In fact, an edge implementation could replace the markup before its actually delivered to the client.

```html
<include-fragment src="/github/include-fragment/commit-count" timeout="100">
  <p>Counting commitsâ€¦</p>
</include-fragment>
```

>A proxy may attempt to fetch and replace the fragment if the request finishes before the timeout. Otherwise the tag is delivered to the client. This library only implements the client side aspect.

So basically, we can have a four-legged "relay race" to deliver content to the user in the most efficient, cost effective manner possible.  A cdn can deliver an HTML include if it is in cache.  If not, "punt" and hand over the HTML stream to the next layer (while caching the resourcing in a background thread for future requests) -- on to the service worker, which could isomorphically go through the same exact thought process, punting to a web component or custom element enhancement (during template instantiation or in the live DOM tree (worse-case)).

However, currently the service worker is significantly constrained in its ability to seek out these include statements in the HTML, because there is no support, without a [1.2MB](https://github.com/worker-tools/html-rewriter#installation) polyfill, which almost defeats the purpose (high performance).

## Demonstrating a commitment to progress (iframes 2.0, continued)

If the WHATWG is at all interested in improving the end user experience, especially for those dealing with expensive networks (which I suspect they are), then I think they should be bold and show some leadership, and help us buck the industries' addiction to restful API mechanism as the only way (outside iframes) for sharing content.

To quote [this article](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/cors/):

>If a resource never contains private data, then it's totally safe to put Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * on it. Do it! Do it now!

But one issue with embedding an HTML stream from a third party, is needing to adjust hyperlinks, image links, etc so it points to the right place.  This is [probably the most mundane, slam-dunk reason for supporting this proposal](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/rewrite-links/).

## A primitive that would make developing an HTML Parser somewhat trivial

If this primitive was built into the browser, creating a full-blown DOM parser would be quite simple, which has been a common (but often thwarted) use case.  As the bun documentation demonstrates:

```JavaScript
const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter();

rewriter.on("*", {
  element(el) {
    console.log(el.tagName); // "body" | "div" | ...
  },
});
...
rewriter.transform(
  new Response(`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!-- comment -->
<head>
  <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
`));
```
